# Chemical Name Generator

This was a simple C# script I wrote for a discontinued Unity game project relating to space (It wasn't that interesting anyway; just imagine No Man's Sky but it's an RPG and more equivalent to Star Trek rather than...No Man's Sky...I guess.)

Basically, what it does is it uses the elements I wrote (yes, **wrote**) on the text files listed and creates Ionic-Bonded chemicals (maybe some other bonds too, I'm not sure) essentially on it's own.
